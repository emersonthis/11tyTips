# Cloning of {{ _G_.SITE_s }} site

Why not use {{ _G_.SITE_s }} as a boilerplate for your own new site?{ data--="page_intro" }

{% _anchor %}
## Install a clone of {{ _G_.SITE_s }} site
{% end_anchor %}


{{ _G_.SITE_s }} site has been designed to help those wanting to start with a static site generator such as Eleventy, without spending a lot of time to find the best architecture meeting their needs. All tips explained in its pages are examplified by its source code: the dogfooding principle!
